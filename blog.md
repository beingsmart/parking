#Smart Saver: Parking App(Name not yet finalized)

>As a pre note make sure, you arrive at the name, 
>once you completely build the app, you intend to build. 


From now on I will maintain two files with dates
  
  1. [readme.md](readme.md) to understand the list of installations, modules, frameworks being used.
  
  2. the one you are reading now to share my personal feelings about the app, the product idea and how much confident(or derailed) 
    about the  app. And yes it is intended to expose this doc to others.

  Even though, I am boggling about the parking and had some weirdest ideas to solve this problem at scale, I got disappointed
  out of fear that *too expensive idea to tackle too little a problem*.
  
  But after a clear thought that parking is definitely a huge problem, solving this using technology is the only thing
  I can do for a smart city.
  
  Following two are the ideas, I too have got, which people are already implementing
  
  [Get Quick Park](http://www.getquickpark.com/)
  
  [Sensor to detect parking slot](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1767642122/pickparking/?ref=producthunt)

  Following are product features in the order of their merit for an indian centric parking app.
  
  ----Core Features--------
  
  - Find a parking place for your car. 
  
  - Find your car at a parking place. 
  
  -----Required Features-------
  
  - Google Maps API 
  
  - Navigation feature
  
  - Current location feature
  
  ----Must have for growth of APP----
  
  - Add public parking places(by the co. and the user)
  
  - show nearest parking places
  
  - parking slot predictability
  
  -----Monetization-----
  
  - location based ads/recommendations, branding. 
  
  - washing service
  
  - Bring households and empty lands to parking(paid parking)
  
  - Paid Parking devices
  
  As of today, I am energized to build the above features and have belief that this app is going to be the NEXT BIG THING
